How to run
------------
Firstly clone the repo to your IDE of choice

Get yourself a STRIPE API key from Stripe's website: https://docs.stripe.com/keys?locale=en-GB

Enter the APi key into the Secret_keys.properties file found in resources

Then it should be good to run as a back end and can be tested using Postman
